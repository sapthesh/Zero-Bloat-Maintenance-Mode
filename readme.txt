A high-performance, developer-friendly maintenance and "Coming Soon" mode. Zero bloat, zero tracking, zero ads.

== Description ==

Zero-Bloat Maintenance Mode is built for WordPress professionals and agencies who need a powerful, feature-rich maintenance screen without the massive performance drag of heavy CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, or aggressive upselling found in popular alternatives. 

This plugin relies strictly on native WordPress APIs and raw PHP logic, ensuring your site remains lightning-fast while giving you total control over who sees what.

**Core Features:**
* **Secret Bypass URL:** Generate a secure link to share with clients. It drops a lightweight, expiring cookie so they can browse the live site without needing a WordPress account or static IP.
* **SEO Control (200 vs 503):** Easily toggle between a `503 Service Unavailable` header (tells Google to come back later) and a `200 OK` header (allows Google to index your new "Coming Soon" page).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Choose exactly which logged-in user roles (e.g., Editors, Subscribers, Customers) can bypass the maintenance screen. Admins always have access.
* **Excluded URLs:** Need to keep your Privacy Policy, Contact page, or a specific lead-gen landing page live? Exclude any URL path easily.
* **Native Custom Branding:** Upload your client's logo using the native WordPress Media Uploader. If no logo is selected, it gracefully falls back to a clean 🚧 emoji.
* **Vanilla JS Countdown Timer:** Add a launch date timer that uses zero external libraries and automatically hides itself when the time expires.
* **IP Whitelisting:** Quickly add specific IP addresses to bypass the lock screen.
* **Admin Bar Toggle:** Instantly turn maintenance mode ON or OFF from anywhere on your site with a single click in the WordPress admin bar.
* **Raw Custom CSS:** Inject direct CSS to style the page exactly how you want it, without loading separate stylesheets.
* **Social Media Ready:** Automatically generates Open Graph (OG) tags so your maintenance or launch page looks great when shared on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, or Twitter.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `zero-bloat-maintenance` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure your settings under **Settings > Maintenance Mode**.
4. (Optional) Toggle the status directly from the WordPress Admin Bar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin slow down my site? =
Absolutely not. The plugin loads zero external CSS or JavaScript files on your frontend. It relies purely on native WordPress hooks and core PHP logic to check permissions before routing visitors.

= How does the Secret Bypass URL work? =
When you share the generated bypass link with a client, visiting that exact URL places a secure, temporary cookie in their browser. They can then navigate your entire site normally without logging in. You can define exactly how many hours this cookie remains active in the settings.

= Will search engines index my "Coming Soon" page? =
Yes, but only if you want them to. By default, the plugin serves a `503 Service Unavailable` header, which protects your SEO by telling search engines your site is temporarily down. If you want them to index the page, simply change the "SEO Status Code" setting to `200 OK`.

= Can I keep my Privacy Policy or Terms of Service live? =
Yes. Use the "Excluded URLs" text box in the settings. Simply type the relative paths (like `/privacy-policy` or `/contact`), and those specific pages will remain fully accessible to the public while the rest of the site is locked down.

= What happens if I don't upload a custom logo? =
The template is designed to look clean and professional regardless. If no logo is uploaded via the media uploader, the layout automatically falls back to displaying a large, centered construction emoji (🚧).

= Why are there no visual color pickers or drag-and-drop builders? =
To maintain absolute "Zero Bloat." Visual builders require massive amounts of code, React libraries, and complex database saving routines. Instead, we provide a "Custom CSS" box. You can instantly change the background color or text styling using standard CSS, keeping your site's codebase pristine.
